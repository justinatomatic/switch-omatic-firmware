# Wireless Smarthome Buttons aka Switch-Omatic 

This is the firmware for the SparkCore based Switch-Omatic project. 
It's a copy of the default [core-firmware](https://github.com/spark/core-firmware) with additional libraries and application code.

Project details are on the [hackaday projects site](http://hackaday.io/project/1935-Wireless-Smarthome-Buttons-)

This firmware depends on two other libraries: the [Spark Common Library](http://www.github.com/spark/core-common-lib) and the [Spark Communication Library](http://www.github.com/spark/core-communication-lib)

## Shoutouts Credits and Thanks. 

The MQTT PubSubClientis based on [Nicholas O'Leary's](http://knolleary.net) Arduino library and adapted to SparkCore by Chris Howard.

The library controlling the WS2812 LED's is based on the Adafruit NeoPixel Library by Phil Burgess adapted to SparkCore by Technobly aka BDub, PJRC and others.
